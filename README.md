This repository contains the documentation, code, and resources for our project submission to HackFS 2024, ETHGlobal. To learn more and explore the details, please visit the following [link](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/himalayazkbarrier-g7qjo).

HimalayaZkBarrier is a cutting-edge platform that offers secure and private data storage solutions for individuals and enterprises. By leveraging advanced cryptographic techniques and decentralized technologies, PrivacySafe ensures the utmost protection of sensitive information while maintaining data integrity and regulatory compliance.

## Key Features

This secure data storage platform leverages cutting-edge technologies like WebAssembly, zk-SNARKs, Fully Homomorphic Encryption (OpenFHE), and decentralized storage (IPFS, Filecoin) to enable privacy-preserving data uploads, deduplication, encryption, and verification. Its decentralized architecture, utilizing Fluence, OpenFHE, and smart contracts, ensures robust security, privacy, and integrity of stored data while optimizing for performance and scalability.

## Architecture Overview

- **Client-Side Processing**: The user interface is built with React and WebAssembly, enabling secure client-side data processing and zero-knowledge proof generation.
- **Decentralized Compute**: Computationally intensive tasks like zk-SNARKs proof generation and FHE encryption are offloaded to the Fluence decentralized compute network for efficient and scalable performance.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Solidity smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain manage deduplication checks, encryption status, and zk-SNARKs proof verification, ensuring data integrity and authenticity.
- **Encrypted Decentralized Storage**: Encrypted and verified data is stored on decentralized storage networks like IPFS and Filecoin, eliminating single points of failure and ensuring data resilience.

## Getting Started
